# Determine if dilution effect adjustment is necessary based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcox test


options(scipen = 10) # Remove scientific notation from output

args = commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)
file1 = args[1]
file2 = args[2]
expr1 = read.table(file1, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=TRUE)
expr2 = read.table(file2, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=TRUE)


# Determine if average level of expression is different
# Determine the difference between distributions of both samples using statistical tests
# If p < 0.05 in both Wilcoxon and KS test then you can confidently reject the null hypothesis and 
# conclude that the distributions are different enough to warrant a dilution adjustment

# Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test, comparing means
w = suppressWarnings(wilcox.test(x=expr1$mean, y=expr2$mean))

# Null hypothesis: expression data from stage 1 and stage 2 are identical populations
# if p < 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis, i.e. the two samples are from nonidentical distributions

# Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test â€” goodness of fit test, comparing cumulative distributions
k = suppressWarnings(ks.test(x=expr1$mean,     y=expr2$mean))
# interpret p-value as above i.e. p-value < 0.05 means the two samples are from nonidentical distributions
# D = K-S test statistic aka the maximum difference between the x & y cumulative distribution function, higher value means larger difference
